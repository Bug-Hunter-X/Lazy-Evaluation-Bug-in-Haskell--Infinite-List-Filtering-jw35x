This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and infinite lists. The function `filterEven` intends to filter even numbers from a list, but due to lazy evaluation, it might not terminate if the input list contains an infinite list or a list that takes a long time to evaluate and contains non-even numbers.

```haskell
filterEven :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
filterEven xs = filter even xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let evenNumbers = filterEven [1..] -- Infinite list
  print (take 10 evenNumbers) -- This will run forever, or until the system runs out of memory
```
